# Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

## Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them.

#### Example

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

#### Example

```python
print("Hello, World!") # This is a comment
```

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.

#### Example

```python
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

## Multiline Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a `#` for each line.

#### Example

```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.

#### Example

```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
